## Idea: Standalone pub-server

Description: Write a standalone pub server following the hosted pub repository specification. Goal could be to allow vendors to host private pub repositories for commercial packages, and/or facilitate internally mirroring of pub.dev for organizations with outgoing network restrictions. In addition to implementing a server, certain tweaks to the pub tool might be required for authentication with 3rd party servers.
